Git Methods 

We work with a number of branches:
The main branch: master - is the final working program. This has a version number for example v0.1, v0.2, making use of a tag
The development branch: develop - is the branch where developments take place. Developers create a local branch based on this branch.

In addition, a number of lateral branches can arise, for example:
hotfixes, release and feature

-hotfixes: branch for bugfixes of the current master
-release: this is the branch where the code/application is extensively tested before it is merged with the master
-feature: is the branch in which new functionalities are tested. In expected operation, this is merged with the develop branch
